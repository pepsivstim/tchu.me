> The sky was painted blue from floor to ceiling as if God had swept his brush in a heavenly arc. The clouds were right there — as if a quick leap could propel me into the puffy mist.

A few miles north of Copenhagen sits Jægersborg Dyrehave, otherwise known as *Dyrehaven* ("The Deer Park"). Founded in the 17th century as a royal hunting ground by Christian V of Denmark, it's a four square mile patch of managed nature preserve for the public and titular animals to enjoy.

I discovered Dyrehaven on one of my first runs in Denmark. It served as an unrelenting training partner for the 2024 Copenhagen Marathon. It was a refuge for my mind, but tested my body with its rolling hills and often fierce winds.

### my daily bread
The park is defined by a set of forests that surround a central meadow often filled with herds of grazing deer. On a hill at the center of that meadow sits a small, stylish palace called the [Hermitage](https://www.kongehuset.dk/en/palaces-and-the-royal-yacht/the-hermitage-palace/) meant to host royal banquets for the monarch.

 One of favorite easy run routes started from my apartment near the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), passed through Dyrehaven, and ended at the seaside town of Taarbæk. The out and back route was six miles total.

Taarbæk sits on the shore of the Øresund strait separating Denmark and Sweden. On the clearest days from the Hermitage hill, I had a pristine view of windmills spinning on the Swedish coast and clouds billowing into the troposphere.

Over on the water was an embankment I paused countless runs at to stretch and listen to music. It was *the* spot to marvel at the expanse of sky and water, with all the ships passing by and even the famous [tunnel-bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98resund_Bridge) far south on the horizon.

The way back towards DTU often coincided with sunset and twilight. Here I sappily listened to soundtracks reminiscent of flying. As if the straight, downward path were a runway I could lift off from with just enough willpower.

#### Danish summers
Although dark, grey, and seemingly lifeless in the winter, Dyrehaven's bare oak forests were a refuge from the freezing rain and violent gales for people and animals alike. Thin layers of snow coated the meadows of wildgrasses like cotton.

But those cold winter months were entirely worth the sunny, warm weather that followed. The trees sprouted green leaves and the withered grasses began growing again. The herds of deer that moved slowly to conserve energy in the cold now moved with more life and vigor than before. The *hygge* I had held onto dearly could finally be cast away to embrace the lovely Scandinavian summer.

## shelter in a storm of light
On the evening of May 10th 2024, my friend across the sea in Lund, Sweden texted me there was a decent chance of seeing aurora that night. I dismissed this as unlikely, especially in not-north-enough Denmark. A few hours later when he told me to check for real, things started looking up.

Apparently a massive solar storm was bombarding earth. I looked excitedly outside my window to see nothing. But after taking a photo I confirmed there was definitely something going on.

Then the group chat for my apartment started buzzing with a few students saying they could see the lights. With little hesitation I set out by bike to the darkest spot in town.

I wasn't expecting too much. I had already checked off my bucket list item of aurora spotting in Iceland. I didn't think anything could beat that.

As I cycled on the path to the Hermitage, a faint, now visible glow began to blanket the sky. By the time I reached the top of the hill overlooking the water, it had become a shimmering cloud of green and violet.

I made my way down to my usual spot off the coast. By then the solar storm was raining in a blazing fury. Those spindly rays of light shimmered in a slow, fleeting dance. Colors I didn't even know could occur in nature shined in the night.

 I spent the next hour wandering around wholly unlit Dyrehaven, craning my neck towards the sky. I got on a call with the Lund friend looking at the same light show across the sea, and we marveled together at the dazzling display of nature. It was completely unlike what we had seen in Iceland.

As I sat alone and dead still in the dark meadow, a herd of deer approached me — the curious ones getting as close as a few feet away. I wonder if any of them knew what *aurora borealis* was.

## an unsuspecting friendship
Of the many of places I could've studied abroad I chose a small Nordic country. Then I signed up for a marathon and chose to live in Kongens Lyngby. 

Through this perfect storm I got to spend countless hours exploring Dyrehaven's many forests and ponds and grassy fields. I got to gaze at the boundless sky above the meadow and marvel at the expanse of the Øresund. Who would've thought a nature park in a suburb of Copenhagen could be so special. 

As the late summer sun was just beginning to set my last day abroad, I laced up my running shoes for a final run in the only place that made sense. It was a foggy evening in the park but not any less majestic. The park still echoes deeply in my memory today.

I don't know when I'll be back in Denmark. When I am, I'll be sure to pay Dyrehaven a visit.
